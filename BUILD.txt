Note, when compiling, you may get a number of "uninitialized"
warnings.  These are not uninitialized.  The compiler can't see that
the function is being exited before that point.

To build:

Linux:

	cd sources
	make -f makelinux
	
Mac:
	cd source
	make -f makeosx
	

Windows:  (latest port unfinished and unworking)

	cd sources
	make -f makewin

Notes

Exiting XLISP:  (exit)


File extensions

	.lsp	lisp source code

	.wks	saved binary workspace (image)


OS Environment Variable:

	XLPATH	when loading a .lsp or .wks file the system searches
		this path first, and then the local directory


Startup

First, try to load "xlisp.wks", if no other is specified, or another
if specified.

If no wks file is loaded, then load "init.lsp"


The init.lsp file that comes with XLISP is important because it loads
all of the lisp code that makes the system full-featured.


(save "myimage")	create image of workspace in file "myimage.wks"

(restore "myimage")	restore image "myimage.wks"


Starting xlisp with an initial image file (and do not load init.lsp)

	xlisp -wIMAGEFILE

e.g.

	xlisp -wmyimage


In all cases, file name extensions ".lsp" and ".wks" are assumed.


Arrays are limited to 1 dimension


File makewks.lsp can be used to create an initial image
